### **1. Add Date and Time Formatting**

Group messages by **dates** to make the conversation flow clearer. You can group messages in React by splitting them into sections based on their `originalarrivaltime`.

---

### **2. Personalize the Experience**

Make it more sentimental:

- **Custom Themes**: Allow users to pick colors, fonts, or backgrounds (e.g., a photo of your mom as a subtle background).
- **Messages Highlighting**: Add the option to highlight important messages (e.g., marking favorite exchanges).

---

### **. Save and Share Memories**

- Add a **Save Feature** to export conversations as PDFs or printable formats.
- Integrate **Cloud Backup** (e.g., Firebase or OneDrive) so memories are stored securely.

---

### **6. Prepare for Public Use**

Since you want others to use "Heartstrings" too:

- Add a landing page explaining the purpose of the app.
- Include clear instructions for uploading files and viewing memories.
- Test compatibility with different JSON file structures users might upload.
